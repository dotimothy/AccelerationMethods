# Acceleration Methods
This repository serves as a case study of Hardware Acceleration Methods from baseline single CPU core using: 1. Multi-Core, 2. GPU, 3. Multi-GPU (TBD). In addition, the algorithm use to compare different broad hardware architectures can also be beneficial in benchmarking devices of the same hardware type for scientific computing applications. 

## Notebook Overview
- <a href="https://github.com/dotimothy/AccelerationMethods/blob/main/NumpyVsCupy.ipynb">NumpyVsCupy.ipynb</a>: A comparison between a CPU-based numerical computing library (Numpy) vs it's GPU counterpart (cupy). Overall, using GPUs can provide massive speedup compared to CPUs when performing operations in parallel (e.g. matrix multiplication).
